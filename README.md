Race-Rat Coupler Design and Simulation
In this repository, we design and simulate a 180-degree Race-Rat coupler for a frequency of 2 GHz using a 4003RO substrate with a thickness of 20 mil, relative dielectric constant (εᵣ) of 3.55, and metal thickness of 18 µm. The characteristic impedance of the ports is set to 50 ohms.

Circuit Design
Substrate Specifications
Substrate: 4003RO
Relative Dielectric Constant (εᵣ): 3.55
Thickness: 20 mil (0.020 inches)
Metal Thickness: 18 µm (0.018 mm)
Tasks
a) Draw the schematic diagram of the circuit and report the line impedances. Perform a circuit model simulation in the frequency range from 1 to 3 GHz.

b) Plot the parameters S11, S21, S31, and S41 in dB over the frequency range from 1 to 3 GHz.

c) Plot the phase of parameters S21, S31, S24, and S34 on separate graphs.

d) Determine the phase at ports 2 and 3. Are the obtained values consistent with theory?

e) Create a layout of the circuit based on the drawn schematic and perform a momentum simulation.

f) Plot the parameters S11, S21, S31, and S41 obtained from the momentum simulation on a single graph in the frequency range from 1 to 3 GHz.

g) Plot the S11 parameter obtained from the circuit model simulation and the momentum simulation on the same graph and compare them.

Additional Exercise (Port Summation and Port Difference)
In this additional exercise, we will observe the performance of the sum and difference ports in the Race-Rat coupler. Connect the Wilkinson power divider designed in the previous exercise to ports 2 and 3 of the coupler. Design the circuit to achieve the following:

Part 1: Power Transfer to Port 1 (Sum Port)
a) Draw the schematic diagram of the circuit.

b) Plot the parameters S11, S21, and S31 on a single graph.

Part 2: Power Transfer to Port 4 (Difference Port)
c) Draw the schematic diagram of the circuit.

d) Plot the parameters S11, S21, and S31 on a single graph.

Feel free to use appropriate simulation tools and software to conduct these simulations and visualize the results.
